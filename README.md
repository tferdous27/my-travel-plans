My Travel Plans

### Description
This is a simple app to keep track of destinations that a person likes to visit.

The project was completed as an exercise for the Programming for Data Science with Python nanodegree at Udacity. The purpose of the project was to test out working with remote repositories, sending updates to the remote repository, and getting changes from the remote repository.

A simple project was created with app.css, index.html, and README.md files. Then it was sent to the remote repository.
